Adjusting your PATH environment
How would you like to use Git from the command line?

O Use Git from Git Bash only

This is the most cautious choice as your PATH will not be modified at all. You
will only be able to use the Git command line tools from Git Bash.

() Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software

(Recommended) This option adds only some minimal Git wrappers to your
PATH to avoid duttering your environment with optional Unix tools. You will
be able to use Git from Git Bash, the Command Prompt and the Windows
PowerShell as well as any third-party software looking for Git in PATH.

O Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Conmand Prompt

Both Git and the optional Unix tools will be added to your PATH.
Warning: This will override Windows tools like "find" and "sort". Only
use this option If you understand the implications.
